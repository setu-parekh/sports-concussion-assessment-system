## Introduction
- As of today, one of the most commonly used tool for assessing concussions in sports is a paper based diagnostic tool.
- When there are thousands of athletes and equally high number of sport medical practitioners involved, this paper based tool can be cumbersome and quite slow.
- Using a computerized tool for both the athletes as well as medical practitioners can help speed up and simplify this proces.

## Objectives
- Design and build a console based application for athletes and medical practitioners.
- Describe the functionality and supported workflows using UML diagrams such as Use Case diagram, and Class diagrams.
